# Auto Shift Scheduler - Complete Project TODO

## Backend Setup
- [x] Create Express server with MySQL connection
- [x] Set up database schema for employees, shifts, and timeoff
- [x] Create API endpoints for employees (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create API endpoints for shifts/schedule (CRUD operations)
- [x] Create API endpoints for timeoff requests
- [x] Add authentication/authorization middleware

## Frontend Setup  
- [x] Create React TypeScript application
- [x] Set up routing and basic components
- [x] Create employee management interface
- [x] Create schedule view component
- [x] Connect frontend to backend API
- [x] Add timeoff request interface
- [x] Add user authentication UI

## Database & Sample Data
- [x] Create database setup script
- [x] Insert sample employee data
- [x] Insert sample schedule data (scripts created)
- [x] Insert sample timeoff data

## Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for backend API
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Test frontend components
- [ ] Test database operations

## Deployment
- [ ] Set up production database
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up build process
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform

## Current Progress
The application currently has:
- ✅ Backend server running on port 3001
- ✅ MySQL database with employees and shifts tables
- ✅ Employee CRUD API endpoints
- ✅ Schedule CRUD API endpoints with improved JSON array handling
- ✅ React frontend with employee management
- ✅ Basic schedule view component
- ✅ Sample employee data inserted
- ✅ Sample schedule data insertion scripts
- ✅ Fixed JSON parsing issues in shift endpoints

## Files Created:
- `server/index.js` - Main server with employee and schedule APIs (updated with improved JSON handling)
- `insert_sample_data.js` - Sample employee data insertion
- `insert_weekly_schedule.sql` - SQL script for sample schedule data
- `insert_schedule.sh` - Shell script to insert schedule data via API
- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application

## Next Steps
1. Test schedule functionality by running the insert script
2. Add timeoff management API and UI
3. Implement authentication system
4. Complete frontend schedule interface
5. Add automated scheduling algorithm

## Usage Instructions:
1. Start MySQL server (XAMPP/WAMP)
2. Run `node server/index.js` to start backend
3. Navigate to `frontend/` and run `npm start` for frontend
4. Run `./insert_schedule.sh` to populate sample schedule data
