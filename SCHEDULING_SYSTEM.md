# Scheduling System Architecture & Logic

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive scheduling system that includes automated scheduling, manual adjustments, and AI assistance for optimal shift assignments.

## Core Features

### 1. Crew Availability Management
- **Weekly Availability Submission**: Crews can submit their availability for upcoming weeks
- **Submission Window Control**: Admin can open/close availability submission periods
- **Availability Locking**: Once admin closes submissions, crews cannot modify their availability
- **Availability History**: Track changes to availability submissions

### 2. Automated Scheduling Engine
- **Algorithm-Based Assignment**: Automatically creates schedules based on:
  - Crew availability
  - Station training and qualifications
  - Work-hour limits and preferences
  - Historical performance data

### 3. Manual Schedule Management
- **Visual Schedule Editor**: Drag-and-drop interface for manual adjustments
- **Real-time Conflict Detection**: Immediate feedback on scheduling conflicts
- **Bulk Operations**: Apply changes to multiple shifts simultaneously
- **Version Control**: Track changes and revert if needed

### 4. AI-Powered Assistance
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI recommends optimal assignments
- **Conflict Resolution**: Suggests solutions for scheduling conflicts
- **Optimization Tips**: Identifies opportunities for better schedule efficiency
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecasts staffing needs based on historical data

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Availability Collection
```
1. Admin opens availability submission period
2. Crews submit their weekly availability through Crew UI
3. System validates availability submissions
4. Admin reviews and closes submission period
5. Availability data is locked for scheduling
```

### Phase 2: Automated Schedule Generation
```
1. System runs scheduling algorithm using:
   - Locked availability data
   - Station training requirements
   - Employee preferences and constraints
2. Generates initial schedule draft
3. Performs conflict and constraint validation
```

### Phase 3: Manual Review & Adjustment
```
1. Admin reviews automated schedule
2. Uses AI suggestions for optimization
3. Makes manual adjustments as needed
4. Validates final schedule
5. Publishes schedule to crews
```

### Phase 4: Schedule Execution & Monitoring
```
1. Crews view their assigned shifts
2. Real-time shift swapping requests
3. Last-minute availability changes (emergency only)
4. Performance tracking and reporting
```

## Database Schema Additions

### Availability Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE availability_submissions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  employee_id INT,
  week_start DATE,
  availability JSON, -- {day: {available: boolean, preferredTimes: []}}
  submission_date TIMESTAMP,
  is_locked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
```

### Schedule Generation Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE schedule_generations (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  week_start DATE,
  generated_at TIMESTAMP,
  generated_by INT, -- admin user ID or 'system'
  status ENUM('draft', 'published', 'archived'),
  notes TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (generated_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### AI Suggestions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_suggestions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  schedule_generation_id INT,
  suggestion_type ENUM('assignment', 'swap', 'optimization'),
  confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
  suggested_changes JSON,
  applied BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  applied_at TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (schedule_generation_id) REFERENCES schedule_generations(id)
);
```

## API Endpoints Needed

### Availability Management
- `POST /api/availability/submit` - Crew submits availability
- `GET /api/availability/:employeeId/:weekStart` - Get availability
- `PUT /api/availability/lock` - Admin locks availability period
- `GET /api/availability/status` - Check submission status

### Schedule Generation
- `POST /api/schedule/generate` - Generate automated schedule
- `GET /api/schedule/draft/:weekStart` - Get draft schedule
- `PUT /api/schedule/draft/:weekStart` - Update draft schedule
- `POST /api/schedule/publish/:weekStart` - Publish final schedule

### AI Assistance
- `POST /api/ai/suggestions` - Get AI suggestions for schedule
- `POST /api/ai/optimize` - Request schedule optimization
- `POST /api/ai/apply-suggestion` - Apply AI suggestion

## Frontend Components Needed

### Crew UI Components
- `AvailabilityCalendar` - Weekly availability input
- `AvailabilityStatus` - Submission status display
- `ScheduleView` - Personal schedule view

### Admin UI Components
- `AvailabilityManager` - Manage submission periods
- `ScheduleGenerator` - Automated schedule generation
- `ScheduleEditor` - Manual schedule editing
- `AISuggestionsPanel` - AI recommendation interface
- `ConflictResolver` - Conflict detection and resolution

## Algorithm Logic

### Automated Scheduling Algorithm
```typescript
interface SchedulingConstraints {
  minStaffing: number;
  maxStaffing: number;
  stationRequirements: string[];
  preferredHours: number;
  maxConsecutiveShifts: number;
}

function generateSchedule(
  weekStart: Date,
  employees: Employee[],
  shifts: Shift[],
  constraints: SchedulingConstraints
): Schedule {
  // 1. Filter available employees for each day
  // 2. Match skills and station training
  // 3. Apply work-hour constraints
  // 4. Optimize for coverage and efficiency
  // 5. Validate against all constraints
  // 6. Return optimized schedule
}
```

### AI Suggestion Engine
```typescript
interface AISuggestion {
  type: 'assignment' | 'swap' | 'optimization';
  confidence: number;
  changes: SuggestionChange[];
  impact: {
    efficiency: number;
    coverage: number;
    satisfaction: number;
  };
}

function generateSuggestions(
  currentSchedule: Schedule,
  constraints: SchedulingConstraints
): AISuggestion[] {
  // Analyze current schedule for improvements
  // Generate optimization suggestions
  // Calculate impact metrics
  // Return prioritized suggestions
}
```

## Security & Validation

### Availability Submission Rules
- Crews can only submit for future weeks
- Submissions must be within allowed time windows
- Changes are tracked for audit purposes
- Once locked, submissions cannot be modified

### Schedule Validation
- All assignments must respect availability
- Skill and station requirements must be met
- Work-hour limits cannot be exceeded
- Conflict detection must run before publication

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Availability validation
- Scheduling algorithm
- Conflict detection
- AI suggestion generation

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end scheduling workflow
- API endpoint testing
- Database operations

### User Acceptance Testing
- Crew availability submission
- Admin schedule management
- AI assistance functionality

## Deployment Considerations

### Performance
- Schedule generation should be asynchronous
- AI suggestions should be cached
- Real-time updates for schedule changes

### Scalability
- Support for multiple departments/locations
- Handle large number of employees and shifts
- Efficient database queries for scheduling

### Monitoring
- Track scheduling performance metrics
- Monitor AI suggestion accuracy
- Log scheduling decisions for audit
